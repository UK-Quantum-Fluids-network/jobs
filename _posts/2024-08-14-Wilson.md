We are looking for an experimental postdoc to join our team at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, within the larger <a href="https://eqop.phys.strath.ac.uk/"> Experimental Quantum Optics and Photonics Group</a>.  The Royal Society funded project will develop a K-Rb quantum-mixture apparatus to enable studies of vortex dynamics in binary superfluids, with a particular emphasis on reduced dimensionality (e.g., quasi-2D disc, or quasi-1D ring geometries) where quantum fluctuations are enhanced. This is an exciting time to join the team as we begin the build phase of the apparatus; vacuum chamber construction is anticipated for October 2024.   

Further details about the post can be found here: <a href="https://bit.ly/QuantumMixturesPDRA"> bit.ly/QuantumMixturesPDRA</a> or contact Dr Kali Wilson directly at kali.wilson@strath.ac.uk

The post is for 24 months.  The closing date for the post is Wednesday 4th September 2024.
