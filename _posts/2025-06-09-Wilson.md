I am looking for an experimental postdoc to join my research team at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, within the larger Experimental Quantum Optics and Photonics Group. The Royal Society funded research project will explore the role that vortices, topologically-protected defects, play in both supporting and destroying emergent quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity and superconductivity. The project involves developing a K-Rb quantum mixture apparatus. We will implement dynamically configurable optical potentials, together with a high-resolution microscope objective to directly visualise vortex dynamics in binary superfluids, and to study the interaction between vortices and pinning potentials, of relevance to almost all superfluid and superconducting systems from ultracold Bose-Einstein condensates to neutron stars.

Further details about the post can be found here: <a href="https://bit.ly/PDRAQuantumMixtures"> https://bit.ly/PDRAQuantumMixtures</a> or contact Dr Kali Wilson directly at kali.wilson@strath.ac.uk

The post is for 24 months (possible extension). The closing date for the post is Wednesday 2nd July 2025.
