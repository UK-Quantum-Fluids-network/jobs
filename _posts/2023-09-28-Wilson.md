We are currently recruiting a postdoc to work on a new ultracold quantum mixture apparatus at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, Scotland, UK), working in the research team of Dr Kali Wilson, within the <a href="https://eqop.phys.strath.ac.uk/"> Experimental Quantum Optics and Photonics Group</a>. The Royal Society funded project will develop a K-Rb quantum-mixture apparatus to enable studies of vortex dynamics in binary superfluids, with a particular emphasis on reduced dimensionality (e.g., quasi-2D disc, or quasi-1D ring geometries) where quantum fluctuations are enhanced.  

Details about the post can be found here: <a href="bit.ly/QuantumFluidsPDRA"> bit.ly/QuantumFluidsPDRA</a> or contact Dr Kali Wilson directly at kali.wilson@strath.ac.uk

The post is for 24 months in the first instance, and there is a possibility for extension based on the availability of further funding.  The closing date for the post is Friday 20 October 2023.
