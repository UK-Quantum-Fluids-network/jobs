* Research Fellow in Theoretical Physics *

Applications are invited for a two-year postdoctoral research position in the Theoretical Physics group at the University of Birmingham, working in the research team of Dr. Hannah Price.

* The Opportunity *

The PDRA will analytically and computationally study such schemes in ultracold-atom and photonics set-ups, with the aim of  proposing future experiments and of exploring the interplay of topology with interparticle interactions and quantum many-body effects. This project involves a high degree of teamwork and interdisciplinary research, with possibilities to collaborate with experimental groups. The position is funded by EPSRC for two years, with an ideal start-date on or before 1st June 2023.

* Person Specification *

- Have (or expect to complete soon) a PhD in Physics (Theory), or have an equivalent level of professional qualifications and/or experience.
- Expertise in one (or more) of the following disciplines: topological physics, ultracold atoms, photonics, quantum many-body systems, or a related discipline.
- Exceptional skills in computational simulations and/or analytical modelling for quantum and/or topological systems.
- A demonstrable track-record of high-quality written research work commensurate with career stage, and appropriate experience of presenting research.
- Ability to communicate complex information clearly to an interdisciplinary audience.
- Ability to contribute to the planning and organising of research, and a clear willingness to work as part of an interdisciplinary research team.
- Ability to assess resource requirements and use resources effectively.
- Understanding of and ability to contribute to broader management/administration processes.

* Key responsibilities: *

- To take initiative in the planning of research, and to identify and develop suitable theoretical techniques and models
- To collect, analyse and interpret research data, and to apply knowledge in a way which develops new intellectual understanding
- Ensuring the validity and reliability of the data at all times, and maintaining accurate and complete records of all findings
- Disseminating research findings by preparing high-quality publications and delivering research seminars and conference presentations.
- To interact with collaborators performing related work at Birmingham and at other institutions, both in the UK and overseas.
- To assist in the supervision and training of graduate students and undergraduate project students on research-related work
- Undertaking administration arising from the research project and dealing with problems that may affect the achievement of research objectives and deadlines.
- Contributing to research-related activities within the Theoretical Physics group and the School of Physics of Astronomy, including attending and participating in group meetings, seminars and colloquia.
- Promoting and valuing equality and diversity, acting as a role model and fostering an inclusive working culture.
