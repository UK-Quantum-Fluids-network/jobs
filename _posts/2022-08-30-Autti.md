We are looking for PhD students for multiple potential experimental projects to be carried out at ultra-low temperatures. Possibilities include using superlfuid 3He as a dark matter detector or a platform for 
cosmological phase transition simulations, instrumenting levitating superconducting probes for superfluid experiments, probing the microstructure of superfluid 3He with nanosized mechanical probes.
Superfluid 3He is perhaps the most influential macroscopic quantum system in the laboratory, and all these projects may have direct consequences for seemingly distant fields such as particle physics and cosmology.

Additionally, simulation projects on superfluid 3He related to time crystals and the behaviour of the superfluid wave function near container walls are also available. 

We also offer a project on cooling small quantum devices to microkelvin temperatures.
