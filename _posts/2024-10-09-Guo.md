The Cryogenics Lab, located at Florida State University, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in Tallahassee, Florida, in association with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, is seeking motivated experimental postdoctoral researchers to join our group for cutting-edge research in quantum information science.
We currently have two openings:
1) Qubit R&D: Focused on developing and advancing a novel charge qubit platform using electrons trapped on solid neon.
2) Quantum Sensor Development: Focused on designing and optimizing quantum interference sensors based on He II Josephson junction devices.
