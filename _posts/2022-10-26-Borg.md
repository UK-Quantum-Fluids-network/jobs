A funded PhD position is available in the Quantum Fluids group at the University of East Anglia for October 2023 entry. The student will work in the theory and numerical modelling of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, focussing in particular on processes involving non-Abelian defects and quantum phase transitions in spin-2 condensates. A suitable background is an undergraduate degree in physics, mathematics or computing science.
