We are looking for a PhD student. In this project, the student will work as a member of the QUEST-DMC team in Lancaster, based in the ULT laboratory. The project entails constructing and using magnetic confinement to study superfluid 3He at ultra-low temperatures. Superfluid 3He is perhaps the most versatile macroscopic quantum system in the laboratory, and this project will have direct consequences for seemingly distant fields such as particle physics and cosmology. The aim is to show that a first order phase transition can take place in the absence of external influence and that this process is described by the elusive homogeneous nucleation theory. This would redefine how we understand phase transitions in pure systems such as the Early Universe, where such a phase transition possibly left behind gravitational waves that a specialist satellite mission may still be able to observe. The work done will simultaneously technologically contribute towards using the superfluid as a dark matter detector in a large inter-university project in the UK.
