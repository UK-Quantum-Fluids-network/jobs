The post holder will work under the supervision of Marco La Mantia, within a project focusing on the experimental study of wall-bounded flows of superfluid helium-4. Applicants are expected to be familiar with fluid mechanics and, possibly, low temperature physics. Some experience with related experimental techniques, such as flow visualization and signal processing, is also expected.
